Directory Overview
- Genetic_Correlations: Running LDSC genetic correlation, identifying pairs of independent (rg < 0.95) traits
- Conditional_Analysis: Identifying additional independent disease GWAS hits in HLA region
- Pleiotropy_Matrix: Generation of matrix of disease hits (summary stats of all HLA GWAS hits combined across all traits by all traits)
- Haplotype_Regression: Running fastphase to identify haplotypes, haplotype regression analysis
- Figure_Generation: Generation of figures to visualize results
